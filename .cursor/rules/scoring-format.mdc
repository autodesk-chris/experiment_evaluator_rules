# Scoring Format and Response Structure

## Color Coding Rules
- **Green (80%+)**: Excellent - Strong experiment ready for implementation
- **Orange (70-79%)**: Good - Solid experiment with minor improvements needed  
- **Red (<70%)**: Needs improvement - Significant gaps require attention

## Total Score Calculation
- **Total possible score**: 70 points
- Convert to percentage: (Score ÷ 70) × 100
- Apply color coding based on percentage

## Response Format

When evaluating an experiment, provide:

1. **Overall Score**: X/70 (Y%)
2. **Color Classification**: Green/Orange/Red with emoji
3. **Section-by-Section Breakdown**:
   - Section name
   - Score earned / Max possible
   - Brief reasoning
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
4. **Summary**: Top 3 strengths and top 3 areas for improvement

# Experiment Evaluation Results

**Overall Score**: 52/70 (74%) - Orange 🟠

## Problem Space (28/42 points)
- ✅ Outcome: 4/4 - Clear business outcome defined
- ✅ Trunk Problem: 4/4 - High-level problem well articulated  
- ⚠️ Branch Problem: 2/4 - Specific sub-problem needs more detail
- ⚠️ Root Cause: 6/10 - Good format but lacks user focus
- ✅ Supporting Data: 8/10 - Strong evidence with minor source gaps
- ⚠️ Hypothesis: 6/10 - Testable but reasoning could be stronger

## Solution Space (24/28 points)
- ✅ Prediction: 8/10 - Well-structured with clear testability
- ✅ Learning Objective: 2/2 - Excellent learning focus
- ✅ Test Variant: 2/2 - Clear implementation details
- ✅ Control Variant: 2/2 - Proper baseline established
- ✅ Audience: 2/2 - Well-defined targeting
- ⚠️ Duration: 1/2 - Duration stated but lacks rationale
- ✅ Success Criteria: 2/2 - Clear quantitative thresholds
- ✅ Data Requirements: 2/2 - Metrics align with criteria
- ⚠️ Considerations: 1/2 - Some risks noted but incomplete
- ✅ What Next: 2/2 - Clear success and failure paths

## Top Recommendations
1. **Root Cause**: Focus more on user problems rather than system issues
2. **Branch Problem**: Add specific details about the sub-problem
3. **Hypothesis**: Strengthen the reasoning with more evidence

## Strengths
1. Strong solution implementation details
2. Clear success criteria and data requirements
3. Well-defined audience and variants

## Areas for Improvement
1. Problem definition needs more user focus
2. Root cause analysis lacks behavioral specificity
3. Duration rationale missing
