# Scoring Format and Response Structure

## Color Coding Rules
- **Green (80%+)**: Excellent - Strong experiment ready for implementation
- **Orange (70-79%)**: Good - Solid experiment with minor improvements needed  
- **Red (<70%)**: Needs improvement - Significant gaps require attention

## Total Score Calculation
- **Total possible score**: 90 points
- Convert to percentage: (Score √∑ 90) √ó 100
- Apply color coding based on percentage

## Response Format

When evaluating an experiment, provide:

1. 
2. **Overall Score**: X/90 (Y%)
2. **Color Classification**: Green/Orange/Red with emoji
3. **Warning üõë (if any)**:
   - This test probably has too many variations to test effectively
   - Your root cause problem scored low. This suggests a lack of clarity as to the problem you need to solve.
4. **Section-by-Section Breakdown**:
   - Section name
   - Score earned / Max possible
   - Brief reasoning (final-only; do not mention internal passes)
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
5. **Summary**: Top 3 strengths and top 3 areas for improvement

# Experiment Evaluation Results

**Overall Score**: 52/90 (58%) - Red üî¥

## Problem Space (28/56 points)
- ‚úÖ Outcome: 2/2 - Clear business outcome defined
- ‚úÖ Trunk Problem: 2/2 - High-level problem well articulated  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Branch Problem: 2/2 - Specific sub-problem needs more detail
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause: 6/20 - Good format but lacks user focus
- ‚úÖ Supporting Data: 8/10 - Strong evidence with minor source gaps
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hypothesis: 6/20 - Testable but reasoning could be stronger

## Solution Space (24/34 points)
- ‚úÖ Prediction: 8/10 - Well-structured with clear testability
- ‚úÖ Learning Objective: 2/2 - Excellent learning focus
- ‚úÖ Test Variant: 2/2 - Clear implementation details
- ‚úÖ Control Variant: 2/2 - Proper baseline established
- ‚úÖ Audience: 2/2 - Well-defined targeting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duration: 1/2 - Duration stated but lacks rationale
- ‚úÖ Success Criteria: 8/8 - Clear quantitative thresholds and stat sig or >10% lift
- ‚úÖ Data Requirements: 2/2 - Metrics align with criteria
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations: 1/2 - Some risks noted but incomplete
- ‚úÖ What Next: 2/2 - Clear success and failure paths

## Top Recommendations
1. **Root Cause**: Focus more on user problems rather than system issues
2. **Branch Problem**: Add specific details about the sub-problem
3. **Hypothesis**: Strengthen the reasoning with more evidence

## Strengths
1. Strong solution implementation details
2. Clear success criteria and data requirements
3. Well-defined audience and variants

## Areas for Improvement
1. Problem definition needs more user focus
2. Root cause analysis lacks behavioral specificity
3. Duration rationale missing

## Scoring Icons
- ‚úÖ Full points earned (80-100% of section max)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial points (40-79% of section max)  
- ‚ùå Low/no points (<40% of section max)

## Presentation Rules
- Do not display per-pass results, tables, or mention that a lower score was chosen. Show only final scores with a single rationale and verbatim quotes.
