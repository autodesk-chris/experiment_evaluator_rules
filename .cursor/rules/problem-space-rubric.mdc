- ✅ **4 points**: Content exists 
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 2. Trunk Problem (4 points) 
**Binary Check**: Was there content provided
- ✅ **4 points**: Content exists
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 3. Branch Problem (4 points)
**Binary Check**: Was thetre content provided
- ✅ **4 points**: Content exists 
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 4. Root Cause (10 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Length (1 point)**:
- **1 point**: Statement is concise (1-2 sentences)
- **0 points**: Ttoo long (3+ sentences)

**Format (1 point)**:
- **1 point**: Uses "[trunk problem] because [reason]" causal structure
- **0 points**: No clear causal link

**Focus (4 points)**:
- **4 points**: Users are the subject, is clearly about an observable behavior, no features/workflows/solutions named
- **3 points**: Mostly user-focused, but minor product/system references present
- **2 points**: Mix of user challenge and product/system framing, partially in solution space
- **1 point**: Primarily product/system focused with little user perspective
- **0 points**: Purely product/system or solution-focused, no user challenge

**Clarity (4 points)**:
- **4 points**: Behavior is measurable in data/feedback and could be solved in 3+ ways
- **3 points**: Measurable and open-ended, but phrasing could be sharper
- **2 points**: Partly observable, with some assumptions about motivation/intent; multiple solutions possible but not obvious
- **1 point**: Vague or unmeasurable, or implies a narrow set of solutions
- **0 points**: Attitudinal, unmeasurable, and points to a single obvious fix

**Operational Rules:**
- Evidence belongs in supporting data, not in the problem statement itself
- Apply these tests:
  1. Does it name a specific feature or mechanism? If yes → solution space
  2. Does it assume a fix or design limitation? If yes → solution space
  3. Can it be solved in multiple ways? If yes → problem space
  4. Can it be backed by data or feedback? If no → too vague
- Include specific recommendations for improvements based on the scoring

## 5. Supporting Data (10 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Structure & Format (2 points)**:
- Clear bullet points or organized presentation
- Well-structured and easy to follow

**Relevance (3 points)**:
- Directly supports the root cause
- Evidence is pertinent to the problem

**Clarity & Specificity (3 points)**:
- Clear, specific evidence provided
- Concrete examples and details

**Source Attribution (2 points)**:
- Clear data sources mentioned
- Attribution is credible and verifiable

## 6. Hypothesis (10 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Belief Statement (2 points)**:
- **2 points**: Clearly states core belief about problem/behavior, aligns with root cause, avoids solutions
- **1 point**: States belief but weakly connects to root cause, or mixes in implied actions/solutions
- **0 points**: Describes action/feature/goal rather than belief; no connection to root cause, uses 'if'

**Reason (2 points)**:
- **2 points**: Provides rationale that logically follows from insights/evidence and connects to user behavior
- **1 point**: Offers reason but vague, generic, or loosely related to problem
- **0 points**: No rationale or relies purely on speculation

**Falsifiability (3 points)**:
- **3 points**: Can be definitively validated or refuted with specific, measurable outcomes
- **2 points**: Mostly testable, but contains ambiguous or subjective elements
- **1 point**: Difficult to test or relies heavily on qualitative judgment
- **0 points**: Cannot be validated or falsified through measurement

**Reflects supporting data (3 points)**:
- **3 points**: Directly addresses root cause and is consistent with supporting data
- **2 points**: Generally consistent with insights but overlooks key aspects
- **1 point**: Weakly connected to insights, or potentially contradicts them
- **0 points**: No connection to root cause or ignores available evidence

**Operational Rules:**
- Deduct points for:
  - Future-tense or conditional language ('will', 'should', 'could')
  - Solution- or feature-oriented framing
  - Vague or unmeasurable statements
  - Multiple beliefs embedded in one statement
- Apply these tests:
  1. Can the belief be proven false?
  2. Is it written as a belief, not a solution/goal?
  3. Does it connect to the root cause?
  4. Is it logically supported by evidence?
