# Problem Space Sections (56 points total)

## Scope Enforcement (Problem Space)
- Evaluate each section from its own parsed content only.
- Cross-section use is only allowed where explicitly stated below and must be quoted and labeled.
- Two-pass scoring is internal; only final scores, a single rationale, and quotes are reported.

## Allowed Dependencies Map (Problem Space)
- Outcome: none
- Trunk Problem: none
- Branch Problem: none
- Root Cause: none
- Supporting Data: none
- Hypothesis:
  - Root cause alignment (sub-criterion): allowed dependency = Root Cause
  - Reflects supporting data (sub-criterion): allowed dependency = Supporting Data

## 1. Outcome (2 points)
**Binary Check**: Was there content provided
- ✅ **2 points**: Content exists 
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 2. Trunk Problem (2 points) 
**Binary Check**: Was there content provided
- ✅ **2 points**: Content exists
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 3. Branch Problem (2 points)
**Binary Check**: Was there content provided
- ✅ **2 points**: Content exists 
- ❌ **0 points**: Content is missing

## 4. Root Cause (20 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Length (2 points)**:
- **2 points**: Statement is concise (1-2 sentences)
- **0 points**: Too long (3+ sentences)

**Format (2 points)**:
- **2 points**: Uses "[trunk problem] because [reason]" causal structure
- **0 points**: No clear causal link

**Focus (8 points)**:
- **8 points**: Users are the subject, is clearly about an observable behavior, no features/workflows/solutions named
- **6 points**: Mostly user-focused, but minor product/system references present
- **4 points**: Mix of user challenge and product/system framing, partially in solution space
- **2 points**: Primarily product/system focused with little user perspective
- **0 points**: Purely product/system or solution-focused, no user challenge

**Clarity (8 points)**:
- **8 points**: Behavior is observable in data/feedback and could be solved in 3+ ways
- **6 points**: observable and open-ended, but phrasing could be sharper
- **4 points**: Partly observable, with some assumptions about motivation/intent; multiple solutions possible but not obvious
- **2 points**: Vague or not observable or implies a narrow set of solutions
- **0 points**: Attitudinal, unmeasurable, and points to a single obvious fix

**Operational Rules:**
- Evidence belongs in supporting data, not in the problem statement itself
- Apply these tests:
  1. Does it name a specific feature or mechanism? If yes → solution space
  2. Does it assume a fix or design limitation? If yes → solution space
  3. Can it be solved in multiple ways? If yes → problem space
  4. Can it be backed by data or feedback? If no → too vague
- Include specific recommendations for improvements based on the scoring

Additional enforcement (machine-checkable):
- Length (2): Count sentences; if >2, assign 0.
- Format (2): Must use "[trunk problem] because [reason]"; else 0.
- Focus (8): If solution words/feature names/workflows (e.g., "CTA", "Board", "Site Design") appear, step down at least one band.
- Clarity (8): Require both (a) observable behavior and (b) multiple plausible solutions; if either is missing in the parsed text, step down one band.

## 5. Supporting Data (10 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Structure & Format (2 points)**:
- Clear bullet points or organized presentation
- Well-structured and easy to follow

**Relevance (3 points)**:
- Directly supports the root cause
- Evidence is pertinent to the problem

**Clarity & Specificity (3 points)**:
- Clear, specific evidence provided
- Concrete examples and details

**Source Attribution (2 points)**:
- Clear data sources mentioned
- Attribution is credible and verifiable

## 6. Hypothesis (20 points)
**AI Evaluation** - Score across 4 criteria:

**Belief Statement (4 points)**:
- **4 points**: Clearly states core belief about problem/behavior, aligns with root cause, avoids solutions
- **2 points**: States belief but weakly connects to root cause, or mixes in implied actions/solutions
- **0 points**: Describes action/feature/goal rather than belief; no connection to root cause, uses 'if'

**Root cause alignment (2 points)**:
- **2 points**: Provides rationale that aligns to the root cause and connects to supporting data provided
- **1 points**: Rationale is vague, generic, or loosely related to root cause
- **0 points**: No rationale or relies purely on speculation

**Falsifiability (6 points)**:
- **6 points**: Can be definitively validated or refuted with specific, measurable outcomes
- **4 points**: Mostly testable, but contains ambiguous or subjective elements
- **2 points**: Difficult to test or relies heavily on qualitative judgment
- **0 points**: Cannot be validated or falsified through measurement

**Reflects supporting data (8 points)**:
- **8 points**: Directly addresses root cause and is consistent with supporting data
- **6 points**: Generally consistent with supporting data but overlooks key aspects
- **4 points**: Weakly connected to supporting data, or potentially contradicts them
- **0 points**: No connection to root cause or ignores supporting data

**Operational Rules:**
- Max score = 20.
- Deduct points where future tense of conditional language ('if','should', 'could') is used, have solution of feature oriented framing, are vague or include multiple beliefs. 
- A lack of evidence stated in the hypothesis should not lead to points dection. Evidence belongs in suppoprting data
- Apply these tests:
  1. Can the belief be proven false?
  2. Is it written as a belief, not a solution/goal?
  3. Does it connect to the root cause?
  4. Is it logically supported by evidence, without needed tio state specific data points.

Dependency rules (Hypothesis only):
- Root cause alignment (2): allowed dependency = Root Cause; quotes required from Hypothesis and Root Cause. If Root Cause lacks needed content → score 0 here.
- Reflects supporting data (8): allowed dependency = Supporting Data; quotes required from Hypothesis and Supporting Data. If Supporting Data lacks needed content → score lowest band here.
