# Sample Experiment Brief

## Outcome
Increase user engagement with onboarding content to improve feature adoption and long-term user retention.

## Trunk Problem
New users struggle to understand the value and functionality of key product features after initial signup.

## Branch Problem
Users who complete basic onboarding often don't revisit training materials when they encounter advanced features later in their journey.

## Root Cause
Users abandon advanced features because they lack easy access to contextual help when they need it most.

## Supporting Data
• 65% of users complete initial onboarding but only 12% engage with advanced features within 30 days
• User interviews reveal 78% want "just-in-time" help rather than upfront training
• Support tickets show 40% of questions are about features covered in onboarding
• Heat map data shows users spend <2 minutes on help documentation pages

## Hypothesis
We believe that providing persistent, contextual access to onboarding content will increase feature engagement because users prefer just-in-time learning over comprehensive upfront training.

## Prediction
If we provide persistent access to onboarding content through a visible CTA, then users will engage more with advanced features and require less support.

## Test Title
Persistent Onboarding Access Test

## Short Description
Test the impact of a persistent "View Onboarding" CTA on user engagement with advanced features.

## Test Learning Objective
Does persistent access to self-serve onboarding content increase the likelihood of a user engaging with key functionality and workflows?

## Test Type
A/B Test

## Test Variant Description
Variant users receive the onboarding training as per the current flow, then see a persistent and highly visible 'view onboarding' CTA, wherever they are working. Users should be able to access without necessarily clicking into another menu. Possible in-product survey to users that don't click CTA to understand why.

## Control Variant Description
Control users experience the current onboarding flow with no additional access points to training materials after initial completion.

## Audience
New users who have completed basic onboarding within the last 30 days, randomly split 50/50 between control and variant groups.

## Duration
4 weeks to capture sufficient user interactions and account for typical feature discovery patterns, based on historical data showing peak feature exploration occurs within 30 days.

## Success Criteria
Test succeeds if variant group shows >20% lift in advanced feature engagement compared to control group, with statistical significance (p<0.05).

## Data Requirements
Training revisits, workflow and feature usage, click through rate on CTA to be measured. Review data based on 7 days cohorts. Possible in-product survey to targeting users that don't click CTA to understand why they didn't click. This would have to be shared at least 7 days after (consider timing and effect on experiment results).

## Considerations and investigation requirements
Consider whether we do an in-product survey to get qualitative info on why users may not have clicked CTA.

## What next
Test succeeds: Roll out to all users
Test fails: Run follow-up test based on understanding why test failed eg. didn't see CTA, didn't see the value, saw it but content not compelling.
